Is this the end or beginning?
I can sense now your goodbye
I'm feeling more than I'm feeling
Wondering what went on your mind

You never gave us a chance to really try
And those really stood behind you
How did you know what to say or
Would it stop a spinning wheel

And I hope, somehow
That you're happy now
'Cause whether my right or wrong reason
It's crying season again

Whether I'm wrong or right
It don't matter if it's the end
Whether I'm right or wrong
It don't make a difference, my friend

We have some good, good times
We have good, good times together
We have some good, good times
We have good, good times together

Remember?
Remember?
(I'm trying to) Remember
(I'm trying to) Remember

And I hope, somehow
That you're happy now
'Cause whether my right or wrong reason
It's crying season again
